- Random Experiments and Sample Space ($\Omega$)
- Probability Measure ($\mathbb{P}$) and it's axioms
- Sigma-Algebra ($\mathcal{F}$)
  - Null set
  - Element and it's complement
  - Closure under countable union of disjoint element
- Borel $\sigma$-algebra $\mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R})$
  - When $\Omega = \mathbb{R}$
- Conditional Probability
  - Chain rule
  $$P(A_1 \cap A_2 \ldots A_n) = P(A_1) P(A_2 | A_1) P(A_3 | A_1 \cap A_2) \ldots P(A_n | A_1 \cap A_2 \cap \ldots A_{n-1})$$
<!--- Law of Total Probabcliy-->
- Independent Events
- Conditional Independence $P(AB | C) = P(A|C) P(B|C)$
- Mutually exclusive and Independence
  - If one has zero-probability then related.
- Random Variable
  - Map from one probability space to another
  - Most cases the resultant probability space has sample space $\mathbb{R}$.
  $$\therefore \ (\Omega,\ \mathcal{F},\ \mathbb{P}(.)) \ \stackrel{X}{\longrightarrow} \ (\mathbb{R}, \ \mathcal{B}(\mathbb{R}),\ \mathbb{P}_X(.))$$
    - $X^{-1} (B)$ is called the preimage or the inverse image of $B$. 
  - Discrete vs Continuous R.V.
  - nth moment $E[X^n]$
  - Law of unconscious statistician $E[g(X)] = \sum g(x) p_X(x)$.
  - Joint Random Variabless
